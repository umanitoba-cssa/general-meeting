## SSA Constitution Changes:

![SSA Constitution Changes](img-constitution-changes.png)

The SSA is trying to bring changes for us to get the funding that is provided to them, to distribute to science clubs with a few terms that would ultimately restrict what we can say and do within our constitution. We would prefer to not add these changes to our constitution as some of them are quite vague, or don't have good definitions, or should be left to voting whether that be a general meeting/council decision/election decision. We want to allow the CSSA to be flexible and adapt, and also want to be looking out to the future with our constitution. There are also some penalties if we do not follow these terms, which would take funding away from us.
