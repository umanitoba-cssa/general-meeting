## Overview

As of the current version (July 5th, 2025), this guide covers:
- **Choosing Computer Science as your major**. Ever wondered if Computer Science would be the right major for you? This topic is suited for prospective students to get to know what Computer Science in University of Manitoba is all about.
- **Tuitions and scholarships**. New to budgeting? Get an overview of what kind of funds you'll need to spend, and can earn throughout university.
- **University preparations**. Adjusting to university can get confusing and overwhelming, especially coming from high school. Never discourage yourself and get to know what you can do to prepare yourself for university.
- **Course registration**. Unlike high school, you would need to register for your own courses. This can be challenging to understand, as there are so many pathways you could take regarding your courses. We provide information on what courses you’ll need to take for different degrees in Computer Science and some sample pathways.
- **Getting involved**. Make friends! There are many talented people as they are equally fun in our community of Computer Science students. The best way to level up and stand out amongst your peers is to show presence in and learn from the community.

While the guide itself is as comprehensive as we could make it, it’s still highly recommended for you to do your own research about your incoming university life! This document is highly opinionated and based on the personal experiences of students who have experienced at least one year of university and understand the struggles of incoming students into Computer Science. It’s best for this guide to be used as a starting point for you to plan for university as you conduct your own information gathering to build on top of that.

If you have any questions, feel free to send us an email at [cssa@umanitoba.ca](mailto:cssa@umanitoba.ca), or join our [Discord](https://discord.umanitobacssa.ca/) and we’ll be happy to help you! We hope you find the First Year Guide useful!

Best regards,
